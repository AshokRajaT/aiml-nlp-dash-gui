# GUI For NLP Text Classification With Dash

Dash based GUI for testing text classification with NLP models like BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet etc. 

This was created as part of the final capstone project of AIML course with Great Learning

Note: This project dose not contain the source code for creating the model. This GUI interacts with the pickled mode to render output

More details about this GUI can be found in this video https://youtu.be/BsmveGkT2Po
